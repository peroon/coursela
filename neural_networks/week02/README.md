	* common
* recurrent NN
	* remember, but difficult
* symmetrically-connected network

## deep

* two or more hidden units : deep

## text generation

* by recurrent NN
* predict next character

## Pending

* Compared to machine learning course, the course is very difficult. I decided to stop taking the course.
