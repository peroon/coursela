### How to devide data

* Training/Validation/Test data

### Basic flow of machine learning

* define a cost function
* differentiate it by parameters
* optimize with gradient descent

### How to try and error

* judge whetehr high bias or high variance
	* from test error graph(learning curve)
* if high bias
	* under fitting
	* increase feature vector dimension
* if high variance
	* over fitting
	* increase learning data学習データの数を増やす
	* regularization

### Algorithms

* Learinng
	* Supervised
		* Linear regression
		* Logistic regression
		* Neural network
		* Support vector machine
		* Collaborative filtering
	* Unsupervised
		* k-means


* Optimization
	* general
		* Gradient descent
		* Stochastic gradient descent
	* NN
		* Backpropagation
	

### Application examples

* Linear Regression
	* 
* Logistic Regression
	* TODO
* Neural Network
	* MNIST
* Support Vector Machine
	* Spam filter
		* spma word list up

### How to evaluate if biased data

* e.g. 
	* Cancer
* precision
* recall 
* F1 score

### Mistakes

* try many algorithms and parameters and got minimum test error, but it is just optimized to the data and it is not applied generally
